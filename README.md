# rhel.ipscripty py: in this script, i've imported two modules - 1. ipaddress 2. subprocess. The ipaddress module is used to validate the user's input for IPv4/IPv6. The subprocess module is used to interact with other external applications or programs and integration within our script. I prompted the user for two inputs - 1. IP Address 2. Network Interface ID. I stored both of these values as their each respective variable. I defined two functions - 1. ip_address_validation 2. ip_change. ip_address_validation is called to pass through tthe user's input, pass it through the ip.address function and store it as an object if valid. ip_change is called to pass through the validated ip address and run a series of linux commands to pull up the network manager cli, identify the network interface ID, modify the ip address, and bring the network interface back up.
